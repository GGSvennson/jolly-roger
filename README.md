===========

Hibernate Primefaces webapp.

Requirements
------------
    - NetBeans 8.0
    - Latest Java 1.8
    - MySQL 5.6.17

This project is the implementation of a web site using Hibernate and Primefaces. It was developed in NetBeans IDE 8.0.1
and uses MySQL as a database. The site was deployed in Tomcat 8.0.9 TomEE.

Hibernate is implemented using Hibernate HQL and Criteria. Both have previously been tested to validate proper operation.
In a first approach would use Hibernate HQL API but the purpose of the application is to solve some unsolved FAQs concerning
the Hibernate Criteria API.

There are two kinds of users, Administrator and Users. The Administrator can operate on the site while the
Users can only view. The defaul user is Lisa who has role of Administrator. The username/password of Lisa are
lisa/lisapass being the password encoded using the SHA256 algorithm.

Captcha is implemented as an input component with a built-in validator that is integrated with reCaptcha. reCAPTCHA is a free service to protect your website from spam and abuse provided by Google - See more at: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html
